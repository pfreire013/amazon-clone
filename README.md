# Amazon Clone

This project was not deployed because to deploy the database the account on firebase needed updating. For this reason to run the project we need to emulate the backend and run on localhost.

#Get start

run `npm start` to start the application on localhost

befor that run `firebase emulator:start` to start the backend (firebase authentication and realtime database)


#Resume Application

This application is a clone of the amazon ste, in this clone we have the UI interface as similar as possible with the original. With the integration with firebase we have fully functional authentication. With this we created a realtime database to register the purchases made by the user, that is, each user has his own history of purchases. Another feature implemented was the payment integration with Stripe, all purchases made are registered on the platform.
